## Getting LaTeX Up and Running
We want to give some options such that you can be editing this Template as __fast__ as possible. There are many different ways to run and compile these TeX files. Below will be a list of the options and how to get them set up.

### [Overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com/)
This by far is the easiest way to use LaTeX. Just make an account with Overleaf and you are ready to start. There is a free version and paid version, there are differences and you may not notice them at the start. Overleaf's live preview is really nice, you can see how everything you are typing out is rendering. Potential issues of having too much content that it will take overleaf more than 3 minutes of compile time, which is the limit for the free version. If you happen to run into this, then check out running and compiling locally on your own computer.

### [Atom](atom.io)
This will take a few steps, but very easy once everything is installed. You can follow along with this tutorial [Creating Your First PDF with LaTeX and Atom](http://economistry.com/2016/02/create-first-pdf-latex-atom-mac/).
1. Install [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/get/)
